# Using SimCLR as a Feature Extractor for Classification

This code is using **SimCLR as a feature extractor** to improve classification.

## How It Works

1. **Load a pretrained SimCLR model** (which has already learned to extract good features from images).
2. **Freeze it** (so it doesnâ€™t learn anything new).
3. **Use it to generate feature maps** for images (e.g., for a tulip, it creates a unique feature representation).
4. **Train only the classification layer** (fully connected layer) to map these features to labels (e.g., tulip, rose, etc.).

Since SimCLR has already learned useful feature representations, the classifier can make better predictions on new images, even if it has never seen that exact tulip before.

## What About Unlabeled Data?

The main point of **SimCLR (and SSL in general)** is to **learn without labels**.  
However, **SimCLR alone does not label data**â€”it only learns better feature representations.

If you want to use **SimCLR to automatically label a dataset without labels**, you need to **add clustering**.

## How to Use SimCLR for Unlabeled Data

### Steps:
1. **Pretrain SimCLR** on your dataset (without labels).
2. **Extract feature representations** from all images using the trained SimCLR model.
3. **Cluster the images** using an algorithm like **k-means clustering**.
4. **Assign pseudo-labels** based on clusters  
   _(e.g., one cluster may represent tulips, another may represent roses)._
5. **Train a classifier** using these pseudo-labels.

ðŸ’¡ **This approach is called "Self-Labeling" or "Unsupervised Clustering with SSL".**
